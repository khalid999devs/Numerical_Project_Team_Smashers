Test case #1:
First derivative at x = 3.000000 : 7.000000
Second derivative at x = 3.000000 : 2.000000

Test case #2:
First derivative at x = 5.000000 : 75.000000
Second derivative at x = 5.000000 : 30.000000

Test case #3:
First derivative at x = 40.000000 : 0.900000
Second derivative at x = 40.000000 : 0.020000

Test case #4:
First derivative at x = 8.000000 : 16.000000
Second derivative at x = 8.000000 : 2.000000
