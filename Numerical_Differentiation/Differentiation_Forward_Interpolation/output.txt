Test case #1:
First derivative at x = 0.000000 : 1.000000
Second derivative at x = 0.000000 : 2.000000

Test case #2:
First derivative at x = 1.000000 : 3.000000
Second derivative at x = 1.000000 : 6.000000

Test case #3:
First derivative at x = 10.000000 : 0.300000
Second derivative at x = 10.000000 : 0.020000

Test case #4:
First derivative at x = 2.000000 : 4.000000
Second derivative at x = 2.000000 : 2.000000
