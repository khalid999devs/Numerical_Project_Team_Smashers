# Polynomial Regression

## Polynomial Regression Theory

Polynomial regression is a curve fitting technique used when the relationship between variables is nonlinear. It approximates the data using a polynomial equation of higher degree.

### Key Concepts:

- Extension of linear regression
- Fits data to a polynomial of degree m
- Uses the Least Squares Method
- Coefficients are determined using normal equations

### Algorithm Steps:

- Assume a polynomial equation of required degree
- Form normal equations using sums of powers of x
- Convert equations into matrix form
- Solve the system using Gaussian Elimination
- Determine polynomial coefficients
- Construct the fitted polynomial equation

### Advantages:

- Can model complex nonlinear trends
- More flexible than linear regression
- Provides accurate approximation within data range

### Disadvantages:

- Higher degree may cause overfitting
- Computationally expensive
- Poor extrapolation outside the data range
